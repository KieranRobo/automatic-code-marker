## Automatic Code Marker

The **Automatic Code Marker** is a web based application which is intended to improve the assignment, assessment, and marking experience between lecturers and students at university. It is inteded to replace almost all aspects of the traditional lifecycle of coding assignments at university, which generally involves several manual steps from all invovled (including physically presenting submissions, manual marking, and several more steps).

The application provides tools to lecturers to create specific coding challenges where they can be assigned to classes of students. Students are able to attempt and solve challenges assigned to them all within the Automatic Code Marker, where they are provided with immediate results and feedback on their solution.

Coding challenges within the Automatic Code Marker are based on custom test cases and results, where argument(s) are passed to a specific test method/function, with results compared to its corresponding expected output.
